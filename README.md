# Quick and Dirty CDTV Title Generator

This repo contains a shell (POSIX) script that will take a directory on your filesystem and do all the magic that is needed to create a bootable CDTV ISO out of it.

This repo does not contain any Commodore or Amiga intellectual property.

Usage:

```sh
cdtv-qdtitle  <directory> [iso-filename]
```
